## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

In this project, we will compare and analyze the stocks of **Apple**, **Google**, and **Amazon** by creating three key graphs:

- Stock prices
- Volatility
- Volume

We will use `yfinance` to fetch the stock data and `matplotlib` to visualize the results.

::: {.callout-note}
The dataset covers weekly stock data from **September 2024 to September 2025**.

## 1. ðŸ’° Stock Price Analysis

Our first focus is on the closing prices of each stock, analyzed individually through three separate graphs.

### 1.1 Apple Stock Price

```{python}
#| label: fig-apple-stock-price
#| fig-cap: "Apple stock price"

import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


# Choose stocks to compare
stock_names = ["AAPL", "GOOG", "AMZN"]

# Download stocks
data = yf.download(stock_names, start="2024-09-01", end="2025-09-01", interval="1wk", progress=False)

# Store every stock separartely
stock_data = []
for stock_name in stock_names:
    stock_data.append(data.xs(stock_name, axis=1, level=1))

# Extract the dates for the y axis
x_values = stock_data[0].index

# Extract the close value of every stock
y_values = []
for stock in stock_data:
    y_values.append(stock['Close'].values)

# Display Apple stock prices
plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))

plt.plot(x_values, y_values[0])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Closing Price (USD)")
plt.title(stock_names[0])
plt.show()

```

During the period from September 2024 to September 2025, Apple's stock remained relatively stable overall.  

However, there was a significant peak in January, reaching over 250 USD per share. Conversely, the stock hit a notable low in April, dropping below 190 USD.  

From September to March, the stock appears to have encountered resistance around 220 USD.

---

### 1.2 Google Stock Price


```{python}
#| label: fig-google-stock-price
#| fig-cap: "Google stock price"
plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))

plt.plot(x_values, y_values[1])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Closing Price (USD)")
plt.title(stock_names[1])
plt.show()
```

From March to September 2025, Google experienced a clear bull market, with its stock reaching 210 USD.  

The stock started relatively low in September 2024 at 150 USD. It increased until February, then declined in April, dropping below 150 USD per share.  

While there isn't a well-defined resistance or support level, we can observe an overall "upâ€“downâ€“up" pattern during this period.

---

### 1.3 Amazon Stock Price


```{python}
#| label: fig-amazon-stock-price
#| fig-cap: "Amazon stock price"
plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))
plt.plot(x_values, y_values[2])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Closing Price (USD)")
plt.title(stock_names[2])
plt.show()
```

Amazon's stock started around 170 USD per share in September 2024 and increased to 235 USD by September 2025, showing overall growth during the year.  

Two notable low points occurred in April, while a peak near 240 USD appeared at the end of February.  

There may be a support level around 235 USD, as the stock did not break above this level in December, July, and September.

---

### 1.4 Comparative Analysis

Now let's analyze all three graphs together

```{python}
#| label: fig-all-stock-price
#| fig-cap: "All stock prices"

# Generate a graph containing all stocks

# Normalize the price
y_values = []
for stock in stock_data:
    y_values.append(stock['Close'] / stock['Close'].iloc[0] * 100)

plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))
for i, y_value in enumerate(y_values):
    plt.plot(x_values, y_value, label=stock_names[i])

plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Closing Price (USD)")
plt.title("Stocks")
plt.legend() 
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

The prices have been normalized to show relative performance from September 2024, making it easier to compare returns across the stocks.  

By September 2025, it is clear that Google and Amazon significantly outperformed Apple, both achieving over 35% growth for the year.  

Apple experienced a decline between March and April but began rising again in August.  

Google and Amazon generally move in the same direction, showing similar upward and downward trends.  

Overall, Amazon delivered the highest return over the year, reaching close to 40%.

## 2. ðŸ“Š Volatility Analysis

Next, we analyze the volatility of the three stocks

```{python}
#| label: fig-volatility
#| fig-cap: "All stock volatility"


# Work on volatility

# Find volatily values

stock_return = []
stock_data_clean = []
for stock in stock_data:
    stock['Return'] = stock['Close'].pct_change()
    stock_data_clean.append(stock.dropna())

    # Compute the standard deviation

    stock['Volatility'] = stock['Return'].rolling(4).std()
    stock['Volatility'] = stock['Volatility'] * np.sqrt(13)


# Plot volatility graph

x_values = stock_data[0].index
y_values = []

for stock in stock_data:
    y_values.append(stock['Volatility'].values)

plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))
for i, y_value in enumerate(y_values):
    plt.plot(x_values, y_value, label=stock_names[i])

plt.title("Volatility")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Volatility (%)")
plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend() 
plt.show()

```

This graph shows different volatility trends for each stock over the period.  

A noticeable spike occurs in May, with Amazon showing the highest volatility, followed by Apple. From January to February, all three stocks experienced relatively low volatility.  

Between November and February, Amazon and Google had similar volatility levels, while Apple consistently showed the highest fluctuations.  

There is a period from November to the end of December where Apple's volatility deviated from the pattern seen in Google and Amazon.  

In September 2025, Apple reaches the highest volatility peak among the three, although it begins to decrease afterward. Overall, the stocks display broadly similar volatility patterns.

---

## 3. ðŸ“¦ Trading Volume Analysis

Finally, we examine the trading volume of the three stocks

```{python}
#| label: fig-volume
#| fig-cap: "All stock volume"

# Volume plot
plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))
for i, stock in enumerate(stock_data):
    plt.plot(x_values, stock['Volume'] / 1e6, label=stock_names[i])

plt.title("Volume")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Volume (Millions of shares per week)")  
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This graph shows the trading volume from September 2024 to September 2025.  

Several recurring patterns and spikes are visible. Apple clearly has the highest trading volume throughout the period. Volume spikes appear relatively regularly, and for Google, there seems to be a small spike roughly every one and a half months. Overall, Google shows the calmest trading activity.  

Looking closer at Apple, there are significant volume peaks at the beginning of September and April. In September, the stock price moved only slightly, suggesting market uncertainty. In April, however, Apple's price fell sharply from around 215 USD to below 190 USD, indicating a bearish trend with panic selling dominating the market.  

Amazon also shows a volume peak in April, coinciding with Apple, and experienced a similar price drop during this period.  

Google's volume remained more stable than the other two stocks, even during the April peak, which is notable.  

Since the data is recorded every week, some smaller peaks may be missing. Nevertheless, the increased volume in April aligns with the sharp decline in prices, confirming the market's bearish movement at that time.

## ðŸŽ“ Conclusion

Through this analysis of Apple, Google, and Amazon from September 2024 to September 2025, several key observations emerge:

### Key Findings

**1. Stock Performance**

Amazon and Google outperformed Apple over the year, with Amazon achieving nearly 40% returns. Apple remained relatively stable but experienced noticeable dips between March and April.

**2. Volatility**

Amazon consistently showed higher volatility, with a big spike in May, while Google had the lowest and most stable volatility. Apple's volatility generally tracked Google and Amazon but occasionally diverged, notably from November to December.

**3. Trading Volume**

Apple had the highest trading volume, with notable spikes in September and April, signaling periods of market uncertainty and panic selling. Google's volume was the calmest, while Amazon's volume patterns mirrored Apple during key downturns.

### Final Thoughts

Overall, the analysis highlights how price movements, volatility, and trading volume interact to reflect market behavior. Normalizing stock prices helped to compare relative performance, while volatility and volume provided additional context about risk and market activity. This project demonstrates the basics of stock analysis and sets a foundation for more advanced financial studies.
